# Frontend of voting system for EC
In this I have designed a frontend with a smart contract from where EC can check the results of the general elections. As it is based on blockchain so it is a D-App.




# How to use
After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i

Open two additional terminals in your VS code

In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node

In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js

Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/
